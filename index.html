        <h2>Department of EEE</h2>
        <p style="text-justify: distribute-all-lines;">In the Smart Digital School Bell project, an advanced staff substitution system can be integrated to automatically handle cases when a teacher is absent. This system allows administrators to mark a teacher as absent through a web or mobile interface. Once marked, the backend logic checks the current timetable, identifies the period affected, and suggests available substitute teachers based on their free periods. A substitute can then be assigned either automatically or manually. The updated timetable reflects this change by including the substitute teacher's name, ensuring that the ESP32-powered bell system fetches and displays the correct staff member in real time. The LCD display connected to the bell system will show the current period, subject, and the name of the substitute teacher instead of the original one, if a substitution has occurred. This ensures that students and other staff are always informed of the updated schedule, improving coordination and minimizing disruptions. The backend system includes API endpoints to manage the timetable, mark absences, assign substitutes, and return the current period’s details. This expansion makes the school bell system not only intelligent and automated but also flexible in adapting to real-time changes in staffing.</p>
